  <p>
    FFRecruiter makes use of notifications in order to keep you up to date on the status of your parties.  Once you hit 
    subscribe on this dialog you will be presented with the option to allow or block notifications from this application.<br><br>

    Reversing this decision is very tedious and time consuming, so be sure to click allow.<br><br>
    
    Once you subscribe, you will be able to fine-tune what types of notifications you would like to receive from FFRecruiter.  
    You will not be spammed with things that you cannot turn off via the settings menu in the sidenav.
